# CarPricePrediction



    Problem Statement
    
    You need to build a linear regression model to predict prices of cars based on its technical specifications such as car manufacturer, its engine capacity, fuel efficiency, body-type etc.
    
    Dataset Description:
    
    "The dataset contains 205 rows and 26 columns. Each column represents an attribute of a car as described in the table below."

    "This data set consists of three types of entities
  
     the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics
    
     its assigned insurance risk rating,
     
    "- its normalised losses in use as compared to other cars.
    
    "The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process **symboling**. A value of $+3$ indicates that the auto is risky, $-3$ that it is probably pretty safe.
    
    "The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality etc.), and represents the average loss per car per year.
